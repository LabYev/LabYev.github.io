        <h2>What can you get in our tours?</h2>
        <div class="rate">"It was just incredible! This week in Paris was unforgettable! We lived in a 5-star
            hotel near the Eiffel Tower! We were taken on excursions around the city every day. I feel like a local
            now!" - David Lynch</div>
        <div class="rate">"It was a very relaxing tour of Japan. We were given a choice of two hotels - one in
            Tokyo itself and the other outside Tokyo at a hot spring. I chose the second option and did not regret it at
            all. We were introduced to traditional Japanese culture: geisha, samurai, Japanese faith and traditions. I
            highly recommend it to everyone." - Stanley Kubrick</div>
        <div class="rate">"New York is simply immense. We stayed in a 5-star hotel in Manhattan, and despite even
            a few excursions a day, I probably only explored the city by 20 percent. This tour gave me the idea of
            moving to this city in the future, I liked it so much." - Mike Tyson</div>
