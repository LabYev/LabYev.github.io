                <p>"It was just incredible! This week in Paris was unforgettable! We lived in a 5-star hotel near the Eiffel Tower! We were
                taken on excursions around the city every day. I feel like a local now!" - David Lynch</p>
                <p>"It was a very relaxing tour of Japan. We were given a choice of two hotels - one in Tokyo itself and the other outside
                Tokyo at a hot spring. I chose the second option and did not regret it at all. We were introduced to traditional
                Japanese culture: geisha, samurai, Japanese faith and traditions. I highly recommend it to everyone." - Stanley Kubrick</p>
                <p>"New York is simply immense. We stayed in a 5-star hotel in Manhattan, and despite even a few excursions a day, I
                probably only explored the city by 20 percent. This tour gave me the idea of moving to this city in the future, I liked
                it so much." - Mike Tyson</p>
